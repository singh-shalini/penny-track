## 📂 Project Structure

```bash

├── index.html
├── style.css
├── script.js

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Enter a **transaction name** and **amount**.
2. Click **"Add Transaction"**.
3. Positive amounts are treated as **income**, and negative amounts as **expenses**.
4. Each transaction appears in a list with an option to **delete** it.
5. The app automatically calculates and displays:
   - 💰 Total Balance
   - 📈 Total Income
   - 📉 Total Expenses
6. All data is stored in your browser's `localStorage`, so your info stays saved even after refreshing the page.
